Good question 👍
Here is a **clear, honest comparison** of **what was missing in my earlier roadmap** when compared to **[https://roadmap.sh/ux-design](https://roadmap.sh/ux-design)**, and **what we added after you shared the link**.

I’ll keep this **explicit and structured**, so you can also explain it to your client if needed.

# ✅ What Was Missing Before (Compared to roadmap.sh UX Design)

Your original roadmap was **strong in UI + Figma + practical delivery**, but **roadmap.sh is more UX-theory and strategy heavy**.
Here are the **exact gaps** 👇

---

## 1️⃣ Human Psychology & Behavioral Science ❌ (Missed Before)

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* Human behavior
* Cognitive bias
* Decision-making psychology
* How users think, scan, decide, hesitate

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Focused more on *visual design & flows*
* Did **not explicitly cover psychology concepts**

**Now added:**
✔ Behavioral science basics
✔ Decision-making patterns
✔ UX based on human behavior (why users act)

---

## 2️⃣ Interaction Design (IxD) ❌

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* Interaction design as a **separate discipline**
* How UI responds to user actions
* Feedback loops & system responses

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Mentioned prototyping
* But **did not clearly separate Interaction Design from UI**

**Now added:**
✔ Interaction design principles
✔ Micro-interactions
✔ Feedback & response behavior

---

## 3️⃣ UX Strategy & Product Thinking ❌

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* UX strategy
* Aligning UX with business goals
* Long-term UX vision

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Focused on *design execution*
* Not enough emphasis on *strategy & decision ownership*

**Now added:**
✔ UX strategy & planning
✔ Business alignment
✔ Prioritization & trade-offs

This is **very important for client trust**.

---

## 4️⃣ Information Architecture (IA) ❌ (Under-emphasized)

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* Information architecture
* Content grouping
* Navigation structure

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Mentioned user flows
* IA was **not explicitly called out**

**Now added:**
✔ Information architecture concepts
✔ Navigation & content structure decisions

---

## 5️⃣ UX Heuristics & Evaluation ❌

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* Nielsen’s heuristics
* UX evaluation frameworks
* Design critique methods

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Had usability testing
* But **did not explicitly name heuristics & evaluation models**

**Now added:**
✔ UX heuristics
✔ Systematic usability evaluation
✔ Structured feedback analysis

---

## 6️⃣ Accessibility (WCAG) ❌ (Too Light Before)

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* Accessibility as a core UX skill
* Inclusive design mindset

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Mentioned accessibility briefly
* Not positioned as **mandatory UX responsibility**

**Now added:**
✔ WCAG basics
✔ Inclusive design principles
✔ Accessibility checklist mindset

---

## 7️⃣ UX Metrics & Analytics ❌

**roadmap.sh includes:**

* UX metrics
* Measuring success (task success, errors, satisfaction)

**Earlier roadmap:**

* Testing was qualitative only
* Metrics were not highlighted

**Now added:**
✔ UX metrics basics
✔ Outcome-based UX evaluation

# 🎯 Important Insight (For You & Client)

👉 **roadmap.sh focuses on “thinking like a UX designer”**
👉 **Your roadmap focuses on “delivering UI/UX as a frontend engineer”**

After adding these missing parts:
✅ You now cover **both UX thinking + UI execution**
✅ You are positioned as a **UI/UX owner**, not just a Figma operator
